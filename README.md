## Project Overview

**BankBot AI** is a professional, AI-powered chatbot designed to answer **banking-related Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
The chatbot enables users to interact in natural language and receive accurate, contextual, and human-like responses related to banking services.

This project follows **industry-level standards** and is suitable for:

* GitHub portfolio and open-source showcase
* Infosys certification and academic evaluation
* Local execution, demos, and interviews

---

## Key Features

* Natural language interaction for banking queries
* Intelligent intent recognition and response generation
* Prompt-engineered responses for banking accuracy
* Transformer-based LLM integration
* Configurable and model-agnostic LLM architecture
* Clean, modular, and scalable project structure
* Easy local setup and execution

---

## Techniques Used

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Text preprocessing and normalization
* Intent detection and semantic understanding
* Context-aware query handling

### Prompt Engineering

* Structured and domain-specific prompts
* Controlled responses for banking scenarios
* Reduced ambiguity and hallucinations

### LLM-Based Text Generation

* Transformer-based language models
* Prompt-to-response generation pipeline
* Flexible model configuration

---

## Tech Stack

### Programming Language

* **Python 3.x**

### Libraries & Frameworks

* Streamlit – Web UI and interaction
* Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
* SQLite / JSON – Lightweight data storage
* python-dotenv – Environment configuration

### AI / ML Technologies

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Prompt Engineering
* Large Language Models (LLMs)

---

## LLM Details

* Utilizes **transformer-based Large Language Models**
* Supports modern LLM providers and APIs
* **LLM is fully configurable**, allowing:

  * Model replacement or upgrades
  * Parameter tuning (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
  * Custom prompt templates
* Designed to be **future-proof and scalable**
